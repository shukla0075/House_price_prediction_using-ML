# House_price_prediction_using-ML
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical data and various features of houses, we can build a model that accurately estimates the price of a house.

Overview

Predicting house prices is a crucial task in real estate and finance industries. Whether you're a buyer looking for a fair deal or a seller trying to set the right price, accurate predictions are essential. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze housing data and predict prices based on relevant features.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of various attributes related to houses such as size, number of bedrooms, location, amenities, etc. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering is performed to extract meaningful information.

Machine Learning Models

Several machine learning algorithms are explored and evaluated to find the most suitable model for predicting house prices. Some of the models experimented with include:

Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Support Vector Machines
These models are trained on the dataset and evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess their performance.

Model Evaluation

The performance of each model is compared using cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness and generalization. Hyperparameter tuning is also conducted to optimize the models for better accuracy.

Deployment

The best-performing model is deployed into a production environment where it can be utilized for real-time predictions. A user-friendly interface is created to allow users to input relevant features of a house and obtain an estimated price.
